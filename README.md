## About SmartTab

SmartTab leverages advanced transformer architectures‚Äîoriginally designed for natural language processing‚Äîto bring state-of-the-art performance to tabular datasets. Unlike traditional ML models, SmartTab can automatically handle heterogeneous data types, missing values, and complex feature interactions, all with minimal configuration. It is ideal for:

- Automated machine learning (AutoML) pipelines
- Rapid prototyping and research
- Production systems requiring robust, fast tabular predictions
- Users who want high accuracy without manual feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning

SmartTab is designed to be both easy to use and highly extensible, making it suitable for data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers alike.
